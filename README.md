# EduNexus-App
EduNexus is an innovative peer tutoring platform designed to bridge the gap between students seeking academic support and peer tutors offering their expertise.


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```


## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
